        As this service is still in development, I do NOT guarantee that you will 
        get into a class, nor that this service 
        will have constant uptime, nor that it will notify you when a spot is available.
        In fact, I guarantee nothing!  Although I try my best, do not soley rely on 
        this service to get into your classes.  Make sure to frequently check the 
        official SBCC website in case this service does not work correctly.  
        If you find a class the service is not notifying you about or any other issues, please
        contact me as soon as possible.</p><h3>Thank you!</h3>
